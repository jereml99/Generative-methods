# Exercise Part 3 cont.: 
# Once the realize function works, you can generate the
# tree and visualize the structure as a graph using PyGEL.
#
# HAND-IN
# For the assignment create at least three different trees
# by varying the parameters. You can get inspiration from 
# Figure 8 and Table 1 in the paper by Prusinkiewicz et al. 
# It is fine to simply use the parameters in Table 1 or you
# can come up with your own. In either case, Please discuss 
# how the parameter choices affect your results.
#
# Upload only a single PDF with 
# - the code you wrote, 
# - screenshots of the results, and 
# - the discussion of how parameters affect output.

# Part 4: (Non-mandatory)
# 4a - create the tree in Blender. If you comment out the 
#      PyGEL code, you can run the script from inside 
#      Blender. There is code below which allows you to
#      generate a set of curves in Blender, so this step
#      should be easy.
# 4b - convert the curves to a mesh using geometry nodes.
#      This can be done in a number of ways. I recommend
#      using the 'Curve to Mesh' node with a circle as 
#      profile curve.
# 4c - add materials and leaves using shader nodes and 
#      geometry nodes.
# 4d - create a grove of trees by using Poisson Disk 
#      Sampling to distribute points in a terrain.
#      
# # Uncomment to create a Blender object

#     spline = curve.splines.new('POLY')

#     spline.points[0].co[0:3] = vertices[v0]
#     spline.points[0].radius = radii[v0]
